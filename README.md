# BBC News Clone Application Using React Native 🚀📰

## Project Overview 🌟
Hello coders! In today's build, we're going to create an amazing **BBC News Clone** application using the latest **React Native 0.76.1**. This application will feature a clean build with the latest functionalities. We will access the debugger using React Native, and instead of using Expo, we will create a pure React Native application. 

We will use **React Navigation** for routing and **Vector Icons** for implementing icons. This application will be compatible with both iOS and Android. Let's dive in and start building!
